# Target
We want to use DNN to modeling the furniture.



## Status
1. Use shallow nerual network to do classfication for furniture material.

2. Learning the furniture feature and use GAN to generator different view from 2-d image.

3. Use the step2 result to modeling the 3-d model and use AR tech to show the result.
